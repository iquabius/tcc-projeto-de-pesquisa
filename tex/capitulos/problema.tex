O quê a Programação Funcional Reativa (PFR) tem a oferecer, e como ela se
compara aos modelos baseados em \emph{callbacks} quanto ao nível de abstração
fornecido para coordenação de eventos na programação de GUIs?

% The observer pattern violates an impressive line-up of important
% software engineering principles, like "side-effects, encapsulation,
% composibility, separation of concerns, scalability, uniformity,
% abstraction, resource managment, and semantic distance.

% problems than it solves." ~ Edwards (2009), Coherent Reaction

% "Unfortunately, programming with events comes at a cost:
% event-driven programs are extremely difficult to understand
% and maintain." ~ Fischer (2007), Tasks: Language Support for
% Event-driven Programming

% "This structure is a poor-man's concurrency: the event-handlers are
% coroutines and the event-loop is the scheduler." ~ Reppy (1992),
% Higher-order concurrency
